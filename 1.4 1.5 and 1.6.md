**Notes on Delay in Packet-Switched Networks**

**Overview of Delay:**
- **Packet Journey:** A packet travels from source to destination through routers, experiencing various delays at each node.
- **Importance:** Delays impact the performance of internet applications, emphasizing the need to understand nodal delays.

**Types of Delay:**
1. **Nodal Processing Delay:**
   - *Definition:* Time to examine packet header and determine the outbound link.
   - *Factors:* Includes checking for bit-level errors.
   - *Duration:* Microseconds or less in high-speed routers.

2. **Queuing Delay:**
   - *Description:* Packet waits in queue before transmission onto the link.
   - *Influence:* Depends on the queue length, affected by traffic intensity.
   - *Range:* Microseconds to milliseconds.

3. **Transmission Delay:**
   - *Calculation:* Length of the packet (L) divided by the transmission rate (R).
   - *Factors:* First-come-first-served transmission.
   - *Duration:* Microseconds to milliseconds.

4. **Propagation Delay:**
   - *Definition:* Time for a bit to propagate from one router to the next.
   - *Factors:* Depends on the distance and propagation speed.
   - *Range:* Milliseconds in wide-area networks.

**Comparing Transmission and Propagation Delay:**
- *Transmission Delay:* Time for router to push the packet, independent of distance.
- *Propagation Delay:* Time for a bit to travel between routers, dependent on distance.
- *Analogy:* Illustrated using a highway with tollbooths, caravan, and service times.

**Formula for Total Nodal Delay:**
\[ d_{\text{nodal}} = d_{\text{proc}} + d_{\text{queue}} + d_{\text{trans}} + d_{\text{prop}} \]

**Contributions to Nodal Delay:**
- *Variability:* Different components contribute significantly based on factors like link type, transmission rates, and distance.
- *Examples:* Negligible propagation delay on a campus link but dominant for a geostationary satellite link.
- *Processing Delay:* Often negligible but influences a router's maximum throughput.

*Note: Interactive animations are available on the textbook's website to illustrate and contrast transmission delay and propagation delay.*
**1.5.1 Layered Architecture**

**Overview:**
In this section, the concept of layered architecture is introduced by drawing an analogy with the airline system. The aim is to establish a structured approach to understanding and discussing complex systems, particularly in the context of computer networks.

**Analogy with Airline System:**
1. **Complexity Comparison:** The complexity of the Internet architecture is likened to that of the airline system, which involves ticketing agents, baggage checkers, gate personnel, pilots, airplanes, air traffic control, and a global routing system.
   
2. **Sequential Actions:** The structure is explained by describing the series of actions taken during a flight: ticket purchase, baggage check, boarding, takeoff, in-flight routing, landing, and baggage claim.

**Horizontal Layering Analogy:**
1. **Observation:** The analogy is not complete, prompting the search for structure in the system.
   
2. **Identification of Functions:** Ticketing, baggage handling, and boarding are identified as functions that occur at both departure and arrival.

3. **Horizontal Layering:** A horizontal layering approach is introduced (Figure 1.22) to represent the airline functionality. Layers include ticketing, baggage, gate, takeoff/landing, and airplane routing.

**Functionality Breakdown:**
1. **Layered Framework:** Each layer, when combined with layers below it, implements specific functionality or services.

2. **Examples:** The ticketing layer and below facilitate person transfer, baggage layer facilitates baggage transfer, gate layer handles departure-to-arrival transfer, and takeoff/landing layer manages runway-to-runway transfer.

**Benefits of Layered Architecture:**
1. **Modularity:** A layered architecture provides modularity, allowing discussions about specific parts of a complex system.

2. **Simplification:** This simplification aids in understanding and makes it easier to change the implementation of a service without affecting the entire system.

3. **Service Consistency:** As long as a layer provides the same service to the layer above and uses services from the layer below, changing a layer's implementation doesn't impact the rest of the system.

4. **Adaptability:** Layering allows for the updating of a service's implementation without altering other components, crucial for large and constantly evolving systems.  
5. **Protocol Layering:**

**Introduction:**
In this section, the concept of protocol layering is introduced, drawing parallels with the layered structure discussed earlier in the context of the airline system. Network protocols and their implementation in hardware and software are organized into layers, each providing specific services to the layer above.

**Organization of Protocols:**
1. **Layered Structure:** Similar to the layers in the airline system, network protocols are organized into layers. Each protocol belongs to a specific layer, and the design of network protocols follows a structured approach.

2. **Service Model:** Emphasis is on the service model of each layer, focusing on the services provided to the layer above. Each layer performs actions within itself and utilizes services from the layer immediately below.

**Implementation of Protocol Layers:**
1. **Software and Hardware Implementation:** Protocol layers can be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination of both. Application-layer and transport-layer protocols, such as HTTP and SMTP, are usually implemented in software. Physical and data link layers, responsible for link-specific communication, are typically implemented in network interface cards.

2. **Distribution of Layered Protocols:** Similar to the distribution of functions in the airline architecture, a layer n protocol is distributed among end systems, packet switches, and other components in the network.

**Advantages and Potential Drawbacks:**
1. **Conceptual and Structural Advantages:** Protocol layering provides conceptual and structural advantages, offering a structured way to discuss system components. Modularity makes it easier to update system components.

2. **Critiques of Layering:** Some researchers and networking engineers express opposition to layering. Concerns include the potential duplication of lower-layer functionality and the violation of the separation of layers when one layer requires information available only in another.

**The Internet Protocol Stack:**
1. **Five-Layer Stack:** The Internet protocol stack consists of five layers: physical, link, network, transport, and application layers. This layered architecture is depicted in Figure 1.23.

2. **Book Organization:** The book's organization roughly follows the layers of the Internet protocol stack, taking a top-down approach, starting with the application layer and proceeding downward through the layers.

**Conclusion:**
Protocol layering provides a systematic and structured approach to design and discuss network protocols, offering modularity and ease of system component updates. The Internet protocol stack, with its five layers, serves as a foundational structure for understanding and organizing network protocols.
**Application Layer:**

**Overview:**
The application layer houses network applications and their respective application-layer protocols. Notable Internet application layer protocols include HTTP (Web document transfer), SMTP (email message transfer), and FTP (file transfer). Functions like translating human-friendly names to network addresses are performed by specific application-layer protocols, like the domain name system (DNS).

**Characteristics:**
1. **Protocol Distribution:** Application-layer protocols are distributed across multiple end systems, allowing applications in one system to exchange packets with applications in another.

2. **Packet Terminology:** At the application layer, the term "message" is used to refer to packets of information exchanged between applications.

**Transport Layer:**

**Functionality:**
1. **Message Transport:** The transport layer is responsible for transporting application-layer messages between application endpoints.

2. **Transport Protocols:** TCP (connection-oriented, reliable, flow and congestion-controlled) and UDP (connectionless, no-frills, no reliability, no flow or congestion control) are the two transport protocols in the Internet.

3. **Packet Terminology:** Packets at the transport layer are referred to as "segments."

**Network Layer:**

**Responsibilities:**
1. **Datagram Movement:** The network layer moves datagrams from one host to another, akin to sending a letter to a destination address.

2. **Key Protocol:** IP (Internet Protocol) is the primary protocol in the network layer, defining datagram fields and guiding the actions of end systems and routers.

3. **Routing Protocols:** The network layer includes routing protocols, determining routes for datagrams between sources and destinations within the Internet.

**Link Layer:**

**Datagram Routing:**
1. **Role:** The link layer aids the network layer in routing datagrams through routers and nodes.

2. **Link-Layer Protocols:** Specific link-layer protocols offer various services, such as reliable delivery. Examples include Ethernet, WiFi, and DOCSIS.

3. **Packet Terminology:** Packets at the link layer are termed "frames."

**Physical Layer:**

**Bit Movement:**
1. **Function:** The physical layer's role is to move individual bits within frames from one node to the next.

2. **Link Dependence:** Protocols in this layer are link-dependent and vary based on the transmission medium, like twisted-pair copper wire or fiber optics.

3. **Protocol Examples:** Ethernet has multiple physical-layer protocols for different transmission media.

**Conclusion:**
The layered architecture illustrates the systematic flow of data, from the application layer down to the physical layer, emphasizing the specific roles and responsibilities of each layer in the Internet protocol stack.

This table provides a concise overview of the primary functions, notable protocols, and terminologies associated with each layer in the Internet protocol stack.

**1.5.2 Encapsulation**

**Overview:**
The concept of encapsulation is introduced, illustrating the physical path data takes through the protocol stacks of end systems, link-layer switches, and routers. The layers implemented by these network components are highlighted, emphasizing differences in functionality. Encapsulation involves the addition of headers at each layer, creating packets with header fields and payload fields.

**Encapsulation Process:**
1. **Sending Host:** An application-layer message is passed to the transport layer, which appends transport-layer header information, forming a transport-layer segment.

2. **Network Layer:** The transport-layer segment is then passed to the network layer, which adds network-layer header information, creating a network-layer datagram.

3. **Link Layer:** The datagram is further passed to the link layer, which adds its own link-layer header information, forming a link-layer frame.

4. **Types of Fields:** At each layer, a packet consists of two types of fields: header fields (containing information for processing) and a payload field (typically a packet from the layer above).

**Analogy - Interoffice Memo:**
1. **Sending Memo:** An analogy is drawn with sending an interoffice memo from one branch office to another via the public postal service.

2. **Interoffice Envelope:** The memo (application-layer message) is placed in an interoffice envelope (transport-layer segment) with recipient details. The envelope encapsulates the memo.

3. **Postal Envelope:** The interoffice envelope is placed in a postal envelope (network-layer datagram) suitable for the postal service. The postal envelope encapsulates the interoffice envelope.

4. **De-encapsulation at Receiving End:** The postal service delivers the postal envelope to the receiving branch-office mailroom, which extracts the interoffice envelope. The receiving mailroom forwards the interoffice memo to the recipient, completing the de-encapsulation process.

**Complexity in Encapsulation:**
1. **Message Division:** Large messages may be divided into multiple transport-layer segments, which can further be divided into multiple network-layer datagrams.

2. **Reconstruction at Receiver:** At the receiving end, such segments may need to be reconstructed from their constituent datagrams.

The encapsulation process is foundational in understanding how data is organized and transmitted through the layers of the protocol stack.
