**6.4.1 Link-Layer Addressing and ARP**

### **Link-Layer Addresses and Their Purpose**

- **Introduction:**
  - Hosts and routers possess both network-layer and link-layer addresses.
  - The section explores the significance of having addresses at both layers and introduces the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).

- **Link-Layer Addresses:**
  - Contrary to hosts and routers, it is the adapters (network interfaces) that have link-layer addresses.
  - Hosts or routers with multiple interfaces have multiple link-layer addresses, similar to having multiple IP addresses.
  - Unlike switches, link-layer switches don't have addresses associated with their interfaces, as their role is transparent data transmission.

- **Terminology:**
  - Link-layer addresses are termed LAN addresses, physical addresses, or MAC addresses.
  - For simplicity, the term MAC address is adopted, especially common in LANs like Ethernet or 802.11.

- **MAC Addresses Properties:**
  - Typically 6 bytes long (48 bits) in most LANs.
  - Expressed in hexadecimal notation.
  - Originally designed to be permanent, but software changes can modify them.
  - Unique: No two adapters share the same MAC address.
  
### **MAC Address Management**

- **IEEE Management:**
  - The IEEE manages the MAC address space.
  - Companies buying addresses allocate a chunk of 224 addresses for a fee.
  - The first 24 bits are fixed by IEEE, and companies determine the unique combinations for the remaining 24 bits for each adapter.

- **Flat Structure:**
  - MAC addresses have a flat structure and remain unchanged regardless of the adapter's location.
  - Analogous to a person's social security number, offering a consistent identifier.

### **Comparison with IP Addresses**

- **Structure:**
  - MAC addresses have a flat structure, contrasting the hierarchical structure of IP addresses.
  - Unlike IP addresses, a MAC address remains the same regardless of the network to which the adapter is attached.

### **Frame Transmission and Reception**

- **Sending Frames:**
  - When an adapter sends a frame, it includes the destination adapter's MAC address.
  - Occasionally, switches and 802.11 networks broadcast frames.

- **Receiving Frames:**
  - When an adapter receives a frame, it checks for a match with its own MAC address.
  - If matched, the adapter extracts and processes the enclosed datagram.
  - If no match, the frame is discarded without passing the network-layer datagram up.

- **Broadcast Address:**
  - For frames meant for all adapters on the LAN, a special MAC broadcast address is used.
  - In 6-byte addresses, this broadcast address is FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF in hexadecimal.

The section provides a comprehensive overview of link-layer addresses, their management, and their role in frame transmission and reception, emphasizing the distinct characteristics of MAC addresses in comparison to IP addresses.

### **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**

#### **Introduction:**
- **Need for Translation:**
  - Network-layer addresses (e.g., IP addresses) and link-layer addresses (MAC addresses) coexist.
  - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is introduced to translate between these address types.

#### **Rationale for Link-Layer Addresses:**
- **Design Considerations:**
  - LANs support various network-layer protocols, not just IP.
  - Adapters using MAC addresses enable support for multiple network-layer protocols.
  - MAC addresses offer stability compared to reconfiguring network-layer addresses when adapters move.

#### **Comparison of Address Types:**
- **Hierarchical vs. Flat Structure:**
  - MAC addresses have a flat structure, akin to social security numbers, remaining unchanged regardless of location.
  - IP addresses, hierarchical and changing with the network, contrast this structure.

#### **Frame Transmission and Reception:**
- **Sending Frames:**
  - Sending adapters include destination MAC addresses in frames.
  - Switches and 802.11 networks may broadcast frames occasionally.

- **Receiving Frames:**
  - Adapters check received frames for matching MAC addresses.
  - Frames with matching addresses have the enclosed datagram processed; otherwise, they are discarded.

- **Broadcast Address:**
  - Special MAC broadcast address (e.g., FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) is used for frames intended for all adapters on the LAN.

#### **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Operation:**
- **Role of ARP:**
  - ARP translates IP addresses to MAC addresses.
  - Analogous to DNS but limited to hosts and router interfaces on the same subnet.

- **ARP Table:**
  - Each host/router maintains an ARP table mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses.
  - Includes a time-to-live (TTL) value indicating when mappings expire (typically 20 minutes).

- **ARP Query and Response:**
  - When a host lacks an ARP table entry, it constructs an ARP query packet.
  - ARP query, sent within a broadcast frame, queries all hosts/routers on the subnet for the MAC address associated with the specified IP address.
  - Responses assist in updating the ARP table.

#### **ARP Protocol Characteristics:**
- **Message Types:**
  - Query messages are broadcast within frames, while response messages use standard frames.
  - ARP operates plug-and-play, automatically building and updating ARP tables.
  - Entries for disconnected hosts are eventually removed.

- **Protocol Classification:**
  - ARP is a protocol straddling the boundary between the link and network layers, containing elements of both.

#### **Complexities:**
- **Real-World Complexity:**
  - ARP doesn't neatly fit into a simple layered protocol stack, displaying the complexities of real-world protocols.
  - 
### **Sending a Datagram off the Subnet**

#### **Network Topology:**
- **Configuration:**
  - Two interconnected subnets with a router.
  - Each host has one IP address and one adapter.
  - The router has multiple interfaces, each with its IP address, ARP module, and adapter.
  
#### **Subnet Details:**
- **Network Addresses:**
  - Subnet 1: 111.111.111/24
  - Subnet 2: 222.222.222/24
  - Interfaces on Subnet 1: 111.111.111.xxx
  - Interfaces on Subnet 2: 222.222.222.xxx

#### **Datagram Transmission:**
- **Scenario:**
  - Host 111.111.111.111 wants to send an IP datagram to host 222.222.222.222 (across subnets).

- **Determining MAC Address:**
  - Sender must pass the datagram to its adapter and provide an appropriate destination MAC address.
  - Incorrect guess using the destination host's MAC address would result in the datagram being ignored on Subnet 1.
  - Correct destination MAC address is that of the first-hop router interface (111.111.111.110).

- **Using ARP:**
  - Sender uses ARP to obtain the MAC address for the router interface (111.111.111.110).
  - Creating a frame with the datagram, the sender sends it into Subnet 1 using the router interface's MAC address.
  
- **Router Handling:**
  - Router on Subnet 1 receives the frame and passes it to its network layer.
  - The router determines the correct interface (111.111.111.110) using its forwarding table.
  
- **Inter-Subnet Transmission:**
  - The router interface (111.111.111.110) sends the datagram to its adapter.
  - The adapter encapsulates the datagram in a new frame and sends it into Subnet 2.
  - This time, the destination MAC address is that of the ultimate destination (host 222.222.222.222).

- **ARP for Destination MAC Address:**
  - The router, before sending to the destination, uses ARP to obtain the destination host's MAC address.

#### **Conclusion:**
- **ARP Usage:**
  - ARP is crucial for determining MAC addresses within and across subnets.
  - In inter-subnet communication, ARP is used to find the router's MAC address initially and later the destination host's MAC address.

#### **Additional Information:**
- **RFC References:**
  - ARP for Ethernet is defined in RFC 826.
  - A TCP/IP tutorial (RFC 1180) provides a nice introduction to ARP.

#### **Further Exploration:**
- **In-depth Exploration:**
  - More detailed exploration of ARP is recommended in homework problems.

### **Ethernet Frame Structure**

#### **Overview:**
- **Context:**
  - Examining the Ethernet frame with a focus on sending an IP datagram within an Ethernet LAN.
  - Payload of an Ethernet frame can carry various network-layer packets, not limited to IP.

#### **Ethernet Frame Components:**
1. **Data field (46 to 1,500 bytes):**
   - Carries the IP datagram.
   - Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is 1,500 bytes.
   - Minimum size is 46 bytes; stuffing is used if the IP datagram is less than 46 bytes.

2. **Destination address (6 bytes):**
   - Contains the MAC address of the destination adapter.
   - Adapter B processes the frame's data field if the destination MAC matches or if it's a MAC broadcast address.

3. **Source address (6 bytes):**
   - Contains the MAC address of the transmitting adapter (e.g., AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA).

4. **Type field (2 bytes):**
   - Permits Ethernet to multiplex network-layer protocols.
   - Differentiates between various network-layer protocols using standardized type numbers.
   - Analogous to protocol field in the network-layer datagram and port-number fields in the transport-layer segment.

5. **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) (4 bytes):**
   - Enables the receiving adapter to detect bit errors in the frame.
   - Discussed in Section 6.2.3.

6. **Preamble (8 bytes):**
   - Initiates the Ethernet frame.
   - First 7 bytes are 10101010, and the last byte is 10101011.
   - Synchronizes clocks of receiving adapters to the sender's clock.
   - Last 2 bits of the eighth byte signal the upcoming "important stuff."

#### **Connectionless and Unreliable Service:**
- **Connectionless Service:**
  - Ethernet provides a layer-2 connectionless service to the network layer.
  - Similar to IP's layer-3 datagram service and UDP's layer-4 connectionless service.

- **Unreliable Service:**
  - No acknowledgment or negative acknowledgment for received frames.
  - Lack of reliable transport at the link layer contributes to the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of Ethernet.

#### **Case History - Bob Metcalfe and Ethernet:**
- **Background:**
  - Bob Metcalfe's contributions to ARPAnet, exposure to ALOHAnet, and experience with Alto computers.
  - Co-invention of Ethernet with David Boggs at Xerox PARC.

- **Evolution and Commercialization:**
  - Ethernet's evolution from 2.94 Mbps to 10 Mbps standard ratified by the IEEE.
  - Formation of 3Com by Metcalfe in 1979, commercializing networking technology, including Ethernet cards for IBM PCs in the 1980s.

#### **Application Considerations:**
- **Effect on Applications:**
  - Gaps in data due to discarded Ethernet frames.
  - Impact depends on whether the application uses UDP or TCP.
  - UDP may experience gaps, while TCP will trigger retransmission if data acknowledgment is not received.

#### **Retransmission in Ethernet:**
- **TCP Retransmission:**
  - If TCP is used, data gaps result in retransmission.
  - Ethernet is unaware of whether it transmits a new datagram or data previously transmitted.

This detailed examination provides insights into the structure, services, and historical context of Ethernet frames in local area networks.
### **Ethernet Technologies**

#### **Introduction:**
- Ethernet, despite being referenced as a single protocol standard, comes in various versions with different speeds and physical media.
- Standardized by the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD (Ethernet) working group, Ethernet has evolved significantly over the years.

#### **Ethernet Standards:**
1. **Speed:**
   - 10BASE-T, 100BASE-T, 1000BASE-LX, 10GBASE-T, 40GBASE-T, etc.
   - Speed indicators: 10 (10 Mbps), 100 (100 Mbps), 1000 (1 Gbps), 10G (10 Gbps), 40G (40 Gbps).

2. **BASE:**
   - Refers to baseband Ethernet, where the physical media carries only Ethernet traffic.
   - Most 802.3 standards are for baseband Ethernet.

3. **Media Indicators:**
   - "T" often refers to twisted-pair copper wires.
   - Ethernet is carried over various physical media like coaxial cable, copper wire, and fiber.

#### **Evolution of Ethernet:**
- **Historical Overview:**
  - Initially conceived as a segment of coaxial cable (e.g., 10BASE-2, 10BASE-5).
  - Evolution from bus-topology designs to point-to-point segments using twisted-pair copper wires or fiber-optic cables.

- **Speed Evolution:**
  - In the mid-1990s, standardized at 100 Mbps (e.g., 100BASE-T, 100BASE-FX).
  - Gigabit Ethernet (IEEE 802.3z) with a raw data rate of 1 Gbps and backward compatibility with 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T.

- **40 Gigabit Ethernet:**
  - Extends the successful 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps Ethernet standards.
  - Maintains full compatibility with existing Ethernet equipment.
  - Supports point-to-point links and shared broadcast channels.
  - Uses CSMA/CD for shared broadcast channels with limited node distance.
  - Allows full-duplex operation at 40 Gbps for point-to-point channels.

#### **Ethernet MAC Protocol Considerations:**
- **Switch-Based Ethernet:**
  - Modern installations often use switch-based star topologies.
  - Switches coordinate transmissions, and full-duplex operation eliminates collisions.
  - Question arises: Is there still a need for the Ethernet MAC protocol in switch-based Ethernet LANs?

- **Enduring Constant - Ethernet Frame Format:**
  - Over 30 years, Ethernet's frame format has remained unchanged.
  - Despite significant technological advancements, the frame format remains a timeless centerpiece of the Ethernet standard.

#### **Conclusion:**
- Ethernet has transformed over the years, with increasing speeds, diverse physical media, and dominance of switched Ethernet.
- Despite changes, the Ethernet frame format remains a consistent and defining element of the Ethernet standard.

### **Link-Layer Switches: Filtering and Forwarding**

#### **Introduction:**
- A switch's primary function is to receive and forward incoming link-layer frames onto outgoing links.
- Switch operation is transparent to hosts and routers; they address frames to other hosts/routers without direct interaction with the switch.

#### **Buffering:**
- Switch output interfaces have buffers to handle temporary frame arrival rates exceeding the interface's link capacity.
- Buffers are similar to those used in routers for handling datagrams.

#### **Forwarding and Filtering:**
- **Filtering:** Determines whether a frame should be forwarded or dropped.
- **Forwarding:** Determines the interfaces to which a frame should be directed and moves the frame to those interfaces.
- Switch filtering and forwarding are managed through a switch table.

#### **Switch Table:**
- Contains entries for hosts and routers on a LAN.
- Each entry includes:
  1. **MAC address:** Address of the host/router.
  2. **Switch interface:** Interface leading to that MAC address.
  3. **Time:** Entry placement timestamp.
- Example switch table for the uppermost switch in Figure 6.15 shown in Figure 6.22.

#### **Frame Forwarding Process:**
1. A frame with destination address DD-DD-DD-DD-DD-DD arrives at the switch on interface x.
2. Switch checks its table with the MAC address DD-DD-DD-DD-DD-DD.
3. Three possible cases:
   - **No Entry:** Broadcasts the frame to all interfaces except interface x.
   - **Entry with Interface x:** Discards the frame (filtering function).
   - **Entry with Interface y:** Forwards the frame to the output buffer preceding interface y.

#### **Example:**
- Consider the uppermost switch in Figure 6.15 with the switch table in Figure 6.22.
- If a frame with destination address 62-FE-F7-11-89-A3 arrives from interface 1, the switch filters (discards) the frame as it has already been broadcast on that LAN segment.
- If the same frame arrives from interface 2, the switch forwards the frame to the output buffer preceding interface 1.

#### **Conclusion:**
- Switches, through filtering and forwarding functions, efficiently forward frames toward their destinations without unnecessary broadcasting.
- The switch table is crucial for this operation, and when complete and accurate, it enables switches to make forwarding decisions intelligently.
### **Self-Learning in Link-Layer Switches:**

#### **Automatic Configuration:**
- Switches possess the self-learning property, enabling them to dynamically and autonomously build their switch table without manual intervention.
- The switch table is created and updated as frames are received.

#### **Self-Learning Process:**
1. **Initial State:** The switch table starts empty.
2. **Frame Arrival:** For each incoming frame, the switch records:
    - (1) MAC address in the frame’s source address field.
    - (2) Interface from which the frame arrived.
    - (3) Current time.
3. **Aging Mechanism:** Entries are deleted if no frames with the corresponding MAC address are received within a specified aging time.
    - This helps in removing obsolete entries, such as when a PC is replaced.

#### **Example:**
- For the uppermost switch in Figure 6.15 and its switch table in Figure 6.22:
    - If a frame with source address 01-12-23-34-45-56 arrives from interface 2 at time 9:39, the switch adds a new entry to the table.
    - If no frames with source address 62-FE-F7-11-89-A3 are received between 9:32 and 10:32, the entry for that address is removed at 10:32.

#### **Plug-and-Play:**
- Switches are plug-and-play devices, requiring no configuration by network administrators.
- They automatically learn the network topology and adapt to changes, making network administration simpler.

#### **Full-Duplex Operation:**
- Switches are full-duplex devices, allowing any switch interface to send and receive simultaneously.
- This enhances overall network performance.

### **Properties of Link-Layer Switching:**

#### **Advantages of Switches:**
1. **Elimination of Collisions:**
    - In switch-based LANs, there are no wasted bandwidth due to collisions.
    - Switches buffer frames, ensuring only one frame is transmitted on a segment at a time.
    - Maximum aggregate throughput equals the sum of switch interface rates.

2. **Heterogeneous Links:**
    - Switches isolate links, allowing different links to operate at various speeds and run over different media.
    - Ideal for mixing legacy and new equipment.

3. **Management:**
    - Enhanced security features.
    - Simplified network management, detecting and handling issues autonomously.
    - Provides statistics on bandwidth usage, collision rates, and traffic types for debugging and planning.

   - **Processing Time:** Longer per-packet processing time due to layer-3 field processing.
   - **Pronunciation Debate:** Different pronunciations ("rootor" or "rowter") leading to unnecessary discussions.

#### **Comparison:**
- **Traffic Isolation:**
  - **Switches:** Limited isolation due to potential broadcast storm impact.
  - **Routers:** Effective traffic isolation and firewall protection.

- **Plug and Play:**
  - **Switches:** Yes.
  - **Routers:** No.

- **Optimal Routing:**
  - **Switches:** No.
  - **Routers:** Yes.

#### **Network Size Consideration:**
- **Small Networks:** Switches are sufficient for a few hundred hosts with localized traffic.
- **Large Networks:** Routers are added for robust traffic isolation, broadcast storm control, and intelligent routing.

*Note: Table 6.1 summarizes the typical features of switches, routers, and hubs for interconnection devices.*

### **Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)**

In a hierarchical LAN configuration, with each workgroup having its own switched LAN connected to others, some drawbacks may arise, such as lack of traffic isolation, inefficient use of switches, and difficulty in managing users. These issues can be addressed by implementing a switch that supports **Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)**.

#### **Challenges with Hierarchical Configuration:**
1. **Lack of Traffic Isolation:**
   - Broadcast traffic needs to traverse the entire network, affecting performance and potentially posing security concerns.

2. **Inefficient Use of Switches:**
   - Large institutions with many groups may require multiple switches, leading to inefficient use of resources.

3. **Managing Users:**
   - Reconfiguring physical cabling for users moving between groups poses challenges.

#### **VLANs as a Solution:**
- A VLAN-supported switch allows the creation of multiple virtual LANs over a single physical LAN infrastructure.

- **Port-Based VLANs:**
  - Switch ports are grouped into VLANs by the network manager.
  - Each VLAN forms a broadcast domain, isolating traffic within the group.

- **Isolation and Switch Efficiency:**
  - VLANs isolate broadcast traffic, improving LAN performance and enhancing security.
  - Simplifies the network by replacing multiple switches with a single switch.

- **User Management:**
  - Users moving between groups can be easily managed by reconfiguring VLAN software.

#### **Interconnecting VLAN Switches:**
- **Simple Interconnection:**
  - Define a port for each VLAN on both switches and connect these ports.
  - Not scalable for a large number of VLANs.

- **VLAN Trunking:**
  - **Scalable Approach:** A trunk port on each switch interconnects VLAN switches.
  - **VLAN Tagging (802.1Q):**
    - VLAN information is added to Ethernet frames using a four-byte VLAN tag.
    - Allows frames to be forwarded over the trunk link and identifies the VLAN to which they belong.

#### **VLAN Implementation:**
- **Port-Based VLANs:**
  - Ports belong to specific VLANs, forming broadcast domains.
  - Easy to configure using switch management software.

- **Other VLAN Types:**
  - MAC-based VLANs, Network-layer protocol-based VLANs, and more.

- **Global VLANs:**
  - VLANs can span across IP routers, connecting LANs globally.

*Note: Detailed specifications for VLAN implementation can be found in the IEEE 802.1Q standard.*
