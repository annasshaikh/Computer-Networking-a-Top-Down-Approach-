**Summary and Detailed Notes:**

**Introduction to the Web:**
- Until the early 1990s, the Internet was primarily used by researchers, academics, and students.
- The World Wide Web (Web) emerged in the early 1990s, transforming the Internet into a widely known and used data network.
- The Web operates on demand, allowing users to access information when they want it, unlike traditional broadcast media.

**Overview of HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):**
- HTTP is the Web's application-layer protocol, defined in [RFC 1945], [RFC 7230], and [RFC 7540].
- HTTP is implemented in two programs: a client program and a server program, exchanging HTTP messages.
- Web pages consist of objects (files) addressable by URLs, and HTTP is used for requesting and transferring these objects.
- Web browsers (clients) and Web servers communicate through HTTP.
- HTTP uses TCP as its underlying transport protocol, initiating a connection before exchanging messages.
- The client initiates a TCP connection, sends HTTP request messages, and receives HTTP response messages from the server.
- The server is stateless, meaning it does not store client-specific information between requests.
- The Web follows the client-server application architecture, where the server is always on, with a fixed IP address, serving requests from multiple browsers.

**Versions of HTTP:**
- The original version is HTTP/1.0, dating back to the early 1990s.
- As of 2020, HTTP/1.1 is widely used, with increasing support for HTTP/2 by browsers and Web servers.

**Advantages of Layered Architecture:**
- The layered architecture allows HTTP to focus on its responsibilities without worrying about lower-layer details.
- TCP provides reliable data transfer, ensuring the intact arrival of HTTP request and response messages.

**Stateless Protocol:**
- HTTP is stateless, meaning the server does not store client-specific information between requests.
- If a client requests the same object multiple times, the server responds by resending the object without remembering previous interactions.

**Introduction to HTTP/2:**
- HTTP/2 is a newer version of HTTP, introduced to address some limitations and improve performance.
- HTTP/2 is increasingly supported by browsers and Web servers.
- 
**Summary and Detailed Notes:**

**Non-Persistent and Persistent Connections:**
- In client-server interactions, applications must decide whether to use non-persistent or persistent connections.
- **Non-persistent Connections:** Each request/response pair is sent over a separate TCP connection, closed after the transaction.
- **Persistent Connections:** Multiple requests and responses can be sent over the same TCP connection, providing efficiency.
  
**HTTP with Non-Persistent Connections:**
1. HTTP client initiates a TCP connection to the server on port 80 (default for HTTP).
2. Client sends an HTTP request message to the server containing the path name.
3. Server receives the request, retrieves the object, sends an HTTP response message, and tells TCP to close the connection.
4. Client receives the response, terminates the TCP connection, examines the HTML file, and repeats for referenced objects.
5. Each non-persistent TCP connection transports one request and one response message.
6. HTTP/1.0 employs non-persistent TCP connections by default.

**Advantages of Persistent Connections:**
- Persistent connections address shortcomings of non-persistent connections.
- New connections don't need to be established for each object, reducing the server's burden.
- Persistent connections allow multiple objects or entire web pages to be sent over a single TCP connection.
- Pipelining enables back-to-back requests and responses without waiting for replies.
- The HTTP server typically closes a connection after a configurable timeout period.

**Comparison of Connection Types:**
- Persistent connections with pipelining are the default in HTTP/1.1, enhancing performance.
- Homework problems in Chapters 2 and 3 provide quantitative comparisons between non-persistent and persistent connections.
- References for further reading include [Heidemann 1997; Nielsen 1997; RFC 7540].

**Summary and Detailed Notes:**

**HTTP Message Format:**

**HTTP Request Message:**
- Request messages have two types: GET (most common), POST (used with form submissions).
- A request message consists of a request line, header lines, and an optional entity body.
- Example Request Message:
  ```http
  GET /somedir/page.html HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.someschool.edu
  Connection: close
  User-agent: Mozilla/5.0
  Accept-language: fr
  ```
- The request line includes the method field (GET), URL field (/somedir/page.html), and HTTP version field (HTTP/1.1).
- Header lines include information like the host, connection preference, user-agent, and language preference.

**HTTP Response Message:**
- Response messages consist of a status line, header lines, and an entity body.
- Example Response Message:
  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Connection: close
  Date: Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:44:04 GMT
  Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)
  Last-Modified: Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:11:03 GMT
  Content-Length: 6821
  Content-Type: text/html
  (data data data data data ...)
  ```
- The status line includes the protocol version (HTTP/1.1), status code (200 OK), and a status message.
- Header lines include information such as connection preference, date, server type, last modification time, content length, and content type.
  
**Status Codes:**
- Common status codes include 200 OK (success), 301 Moved Permanently, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 505 HTTP Version Not Supported.

**Additional Notes:**
- HTTP uses ASCII text for readability.
- The entity body is empty for GET requests but can contain data for POST requests.
- The HEAD method is similar to GET but without the entity body; used for debugging.
- Real HTTP responses can be viewed using Telnet to a Web server.

**Header Lines:**
- Various header lines (e.g., Connection, Date, Server, Last-Modified, Content-Length, Content-Type) provide additional context and information.
- Many more header lines are defined in the HTTP specification.
- Browsers and servers generate header lines based on factors like browser type, version, configuration, and caching status.

**References:**
- A comprehensive discussion of the HTTP protocol can be found in [Krishnamurthy 2001].

  - *Browser Support:* Major browsers, including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera, and Firefox, have embraced HTTP/2.

- **Primary Goals of HTTP/2 (Extended):**
  - *Latency Reduction:* HTTP/2 aims to reduce perceived latency by introducing features like request and response multiplexing on a single TCP connection.
  - *Additional Goals:* Request prioritization, server push, and efficient compression of HTTP header fields are central objectives.

- **Challenges with HTTP/1.1 and HOL Blocking:**
  - *Persistent Connections:* While HTTP/1.1 employs persistent TCP connections, it faces HOL blocking issues with large objects delaying smaller ones.
  - *Parallel TCP Connections:* Browsers use parallel TCP connections to mitigate HOL blocking, leading to unintended bandwidth advantages.

- **HTTP/2 Framing Mechanism (Extended):**
  - *Addressing HOL Blocking:* HTTP/2 tackles HOL blocking by breaking messages into frames, interleaving them on a single TCP connection.
  - *Frame Interleaving Example:* Illustrated with a web page scenario, frame interleaving minimizes user-perceived delay compared to sequential transmission.

- **Binary Encoding and Framing Sub-Layer:**
  - *Efficient Encoding:* HTTP/2 employs binary encoding for frames, enhancing parsing efficiency, reducing frame size, and minimizing errors.
  - *Framing Sub-Layer Functionality:* Responsible for breaking down HTTP messages into frames, the sub-layer facilitates interleaving and reassembly.

- **Message Prioritization and Server Pushing (Extended):**
  - *Customized Prioritization:* HTTP/2 allows clients to assign weights to requests, influencing server prioritization for optimized application performance.
  - *Dependency Specification:* Clients indicate dependencies by referencing the ID of the message on which the current request relies.
  - *Server Push Mechanism:* Servers can proactively push additional objects to clients based on the HTML base page, eliminating the need for explicit requests and reducing latency.

- **HTTP/3 and Introduction to QUIC:**
  - *Transport Protocol Transition:* HTTP/3 is designed to operate over QUIC, a transport protocol implemented over UDP.
  - *QUIC Features:* Message multiplexing, per-stream flow control, and low-latency connection establishment make QUIC an attractive foundation for HTTP/3.
  - *Standardization Status:* As of 2020, HTTP/3 is described in Internet drafts and aims to offer a streamlined design building upon HTTP/2 features subsumed by QUIC.
